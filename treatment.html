        <h2>Holistic Recovery Programme</h2>
        <p>
            At Higher Power Foundation, we provide a comprehensive programme treating the body, mind, and soul. Our approach is grounded in the Twelve Step philosophy approved by WHO, which has demonstrated the highest recovery rate globally. Recovery is not just abstaining but also involves changing one’s attitude, lifestyle, personality, character, and thinking, to sustain lifelong recovery and become a respected member of society.
